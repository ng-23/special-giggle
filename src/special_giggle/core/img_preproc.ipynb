    "# Multi-band Sentinel-2 Image Preprocessing Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to preprocess the multi-band images from Sentinel-2 such that they can provide more relevant/useful information in downstream applications. Mainly, this entails combining the various bands and calculating spectral indices to produce composite images that better emphasize certain features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Format\n",
    "This notebook generates an output file - specifically, an HDF5 file. It is structured with each location as the top-most group, and every day (0-729) as a subgroup in each location. The composite images are then stored in the day subgroup of each location group.\n",
