    "# Multi-band Sentinel-2 Image Preprocessing Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to preprocess the multi-band images from Sentinel-2 such that they can provide more relevant/useful information in downstream applications. Mainly, this entails combining the various bands and calculating spectral indices to produce composite images that better emphasize certain features.\n",
